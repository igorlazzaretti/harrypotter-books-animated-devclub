                        Harry Potter has no idea how famous he is. That's because he's being raised by his miserable
                        aunt and uncle who are terrified Harry will learn that he's really a wizard, just as his parents
                        were. But everything changes when Harry is summoned to attend an infamous school for wizards,
                        and he begins to discover some clues about his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way
                        he is greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum and colorful faculty at his unusual
                        school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a mystical world he never knew existed and closer
                        to his own noble destiny.

                        For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius
                        Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir
                        apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort. Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he
                        might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the
                        Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts... he's at Hogwarts."
                        Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his
                        friends. Because on top of it all, there may be a traitor in their midst.

                        Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be deadly.
